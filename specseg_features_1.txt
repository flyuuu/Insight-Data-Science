	segment stats: a list of dictionaries
	one dictionary for each segment containing the following features (in this order)

	.segment #
	.centroid x-coord
	.centroid y-coord
	.total area (pixels)
	.max x dim of bounding box
	.max y dim of bounding box
	.(max x dim)/total area
	.(max y dim)/total area
	.(max x dim)/(max y dim)
	.total pixel intensity
	.mean pixel intensity
	.min pixel intensity
	.max pixel intensity
	.pixel intensity range

	.standard deviation of pixels
	.mean absolute deviation of pixels
	.scipy.stats.skew
	.scipy.stats.kurtosis

	.# of edges

	.MASK PIXELS contained in the segment
	.(mask pixels)/(total pixels)

	.[one for each other segment]
	.for each other segment, 1 if you border it, 0 if you dont
	.the difference in mean pixel intensity between current segment and each other segment
	.product of the two above

	.mean difference with bordering segments

	---

	Not implemented yet

	histogram of gradients from within region
	gradients along edge (identify edge pixels)
	longest actual x and y dim, not bounding box
	how central the region is in the image as a %, so like centroid x,y div the image length/width...
